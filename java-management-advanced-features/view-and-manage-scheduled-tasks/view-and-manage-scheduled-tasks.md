  * Delete an existing scheduled task using the Java Management Service console interface


### Prerequisites

  * You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have received your sign-in credentials.
  * You are using an Oracle Linux image or Windows OS on your Managed Instance for this workshop.
  * Access to the cloud environment and resources configured in [Lab 1](?lab=set-up-and-enable-advanced-features-on-java-management-service).
  * You have at least one scheduled task added for the fleet of interest. If not, you can create one for any one of the advanced feature using below labs.

    * [Configure post install actions and install Java Runtimes](?lab=configure-post-install-actions-and-install-java-runtimes)
    * [Detect Java Libraries](?lab=detect-java-libraries)
    * [Run Crypto Event Analysis](?lab=run-crypto-event-analysis)
    * [Run Java Migration Analysis](?lab=run-java-migration-analysis)
    * [Run JDK Flight Recorder (JFR)](?lab=run-jdk-flightrecorder-jfr)
    * [Run Performance Analysis](?lab=run-performance-analysis)
    * [Track Java Servers](?lab=track-java-servers)

## Task 1: Overview of Scheduled task detailed view
